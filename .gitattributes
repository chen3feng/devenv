# This file contains rules that control how Git handles binary and text files, including line endings

# Set the default behavior, in case people don't have core.autocrlf set.
* text=auto eol=lf

# Make sure Windows batch files preserve CR/LF line endings, otherwise they may not be able to execute.
# Windows batch files require a CR/LF for labels to work properly, otherwise they may fail when labels
# straddle 512-byte block boundaries.
# This is important when files are downloaded through a zip archive that was authored on a
# Linux machine (the default behavior on GitHub)
